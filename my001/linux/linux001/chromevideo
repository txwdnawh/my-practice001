Identify the pid of the Flash plugin used by Chrome:

ps ax | grep -i chrome | grep -i flash 
as of now the plugin is called libgcflashplayer.

Identify the Flash file opened by this Flash plugin process:

file /proc/Flash_Plugin_PID/fd/* | grep -i deleted
or

lsof -p Flash_plugin_pid | grep -i deleted
Look for deleted files.
